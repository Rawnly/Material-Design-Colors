# Material-Design-Colors
Material Design Colors converted to SASS varialbes! 

##Usage
Just `@import` the file and that's it!
```sass
  @import '../path/to/md_variables';
  /*
  your SASS/SCSS file next 
  */
```

#TODO
- CSS file with pre made color classes (like [Coloraiz](http://github.com/webeproject/coloraiz.css))
